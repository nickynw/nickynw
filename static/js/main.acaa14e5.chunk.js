After producing the second version (Version 2, Qbot), I felt that I had a much better understanding of Python. I had used a library to convert excel spreadsheets pythonically into CYPHER scripts to add nodes to the graph database. This experience which later proved useful when doing technical tests for some potential jobs. This also meant I had to learn CYPHER, which is similar to SQL, where I experimented with preparing the scripts I needed for gathering data to form MCQ questions.

It is currently unclear whether the integration of haptics in VR supports empathetic perspective-taking when sharing experiences of health conditions in VR, or whether it promotes learning when utilised as part of immersive `Serious Games' in education. The current project ran a workshop with Parkinson's UK to discuss how the experiences of people with Parkinson's could be simulated in VR, and particularly how their physical symptoms might be simulated using haptic devices. A novel educational Virtual Reality experience (VRE) was developed which reveals some of the biological changes that occur in a Parkinson's-affected brain. Based on discussion in the workshop, the VRE also implemented a first-person narration of some of the thoughts and feelings of people with Parkinson's, alongside passive haptic devices aiming to simulate a number of physical symptoms with low fidelity. The VRE was deployed to members of the public as part of a pilot study, under an integrated-haptics or non-haptic (control) condition. Under both conditions, participants reported feeling more empathetic towards people with Parkinson's following their experience and generally agreed the VRE could be useful for teaching empathy and for learning. The study found that there was no significant difference in subjective measures of engagement, presence, and empathetic perspective-taking, or in information recall tests between the two conditions. However, qualitative discussions with participants in the haptic condition revealed that people felt their perspective-taking was indeed supported by the passive simulating haptics, suggesting that differences in empathy may not be reflected in the survey used in the current study, or there may be a ceiling effect for empathy when utilising VR for sharing experiences of health."),future:["I am
